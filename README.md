## GitHub 30-Day Challenge and Personal Changelog
30 day challenge focused not just on coding, but also personal growth.  Goal is to make a habit of committing time each day for learning and personal growth.

### Goals
My goal for the next 30 days:
- Get back into habit of commiting work to GitHub.
- Spend time becoming familiar with Kaggle and their machine learning competitions. Ultimately, I'd like to enter a competition to get more practice in machine learning and increase my data science skillset. However, I have to juggle full-time grad school, being a single parent of two kids in activities, and starting a new job. 
- I'd also like to start reading [Deep Medicine](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Medicine-Artificial-Intelligence-Healthcare/dp/1541644638/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1573235314&sr=8-3), which I bought a couple of months ago and haven't had time to start.   

#### Nov 4, 2019
- Reading: [The Fourth Industrial Revolution](https://www.amazon.com/Fourth-Industrial-Revolution-Klaus-Schwab/dp/1524758868/ref=sr_1_3?crid=2SK4KUE1BDGO8&keywords=fourth+industrial+revolution&qid=1572623598&sprefix=fourth+industrial%2Caps%2C222&sr=8-3)
- Coding: Python and Machine Learing projects

#### Nov 5, 2019
- Reading: The Fourth Industrial Revolution
- No coding, break for family vacation in Florida

#### Nov 6, 2019
- Reading: The Fourth Industrial Revolution
- Logged 29000 steps on my Garmin watch running around Universal Studios with the kids and spent many hours waiting in line, but 90 minute wait for Hagrid's Magical Creature Motorbike Adventure was worth it.

#### Nov 7, 2019
- Reading: Finished The Fourth Industrial Revolution
- Registered for my last semester of grad school!  Big Data Management and Artificial Intelligence will complete my requirements for a Master of Science degree in Data Science at the University of St. Thomas.  As much as I have loved my classes, it will be nice to have my evenings and weekends back after nearly three years of juggling school, work and kids.

#### Nov 8, 2019
- Catch up time after being in Orlando for short "vacation", if you call running around for five days through multiple parks in Disney and Universal a vacation. :)  Watched professor's recorded three hour lecture for the Big Data Architecture class I missed while out of town and worked through Spark Streaming Databricks labs.
- Helped my daughter with algebra homework, I always comment when helping kids with homework on how fun math is and they look at me like I'm strange. 

#### Nov 9, 2019
- Continue catch up for missed class time.  Finishing up assignments on Spark Steaming.  Starting on healthcare predictive analytics using decsion tree model and Naive Bayes model to predict depression in patients.
- 5 mile trail run with friends for some outdoor therapy time.

#### Nov 10, 2019
- Worked on homework for healthcare analytics class. Using the DE-SynPUF beneficiary dataset (approx 7 million records), the assignment is to use decision tree related methods to predict depression as a response/target.  The most time-consuming part of the project is a large amount of data to process and cleansing/transforming the data as some patients have multiple records for the same year or some data values missing.  Technology using:  Jupyter notebook, python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn.

#### Nov 11, 2019
- Working all day and then straight to three hour class at night, learning limited to class tonight which is covering fast data access in Druid and Kudo.

#### Nov 12, 2019
- Completing training videos for new job, which includes all aspects of financial and privacy laws related to banking or companies that issue credit through a bank. Not having a financial background, this has been interesting for me. Especially the fraud/security training as I have been a victim of identity theft myself and know first hand the damage it causes for consumers when banks fail to screen applicants properly or miss red flags.
- Continued pandas/python learning.

#### Nov 13, 2019
- Missed my commit last night!  It was a long day going to work and then back home to pick up my daughter, and then another long drive downtown to take my daughter to see one of her favorite Korean pop music bands that rarely tours.  But, it was worth it to see my daughter's enjoyment. She works very hard in her honors/ap classes, gets all A's in addition to her dedication to marching band, mock trial, and basketball. And she has to tolerate a majority of my attention focused on my son's disability. The perfectionist in me is annoyed at missing my commit for the day; however, weeks from now, I won't even remember this, while the concert and meeting band members will be a lifetime memory for my daughter. 

#### Nov 14, 2019
- Python/panadas/machine learning work for class assignment.  While my goal this month was to do some Kaggle learning/competition.  This homework assignment is covering much of the same areas of learning.  I will probably have to postpone entering my first Kaggle competition until after this semester ends in Dec.

#### Nov 18, 2019
- Intro to Elasticsearch architecture built on Apache Lucene.  Benefits of Elasticsearch is that it's capable of retrieving information in sub-second queries at petabyte scale.

#### Nov 22, 2019
- Finished up machine learning project for homework assignments due this week.

#### Nov 23, 2019
- Started analyzing inpatient and outpatient records for healthcare predictive analytics project.  Will be looking at ways to predict patients at high risk for hospital admittance based on ICD9 diagnosis codes in outpatient claim data.

#### Nov 25, 2019
- Clound architecture, virtual machines and containers lecture in class tonight.  Signed up for Azure subscription with free $200 credit, I've used AWS in a devops class but have no experience with Azure.  Started tutorial to create an end-to-end data pipeline to derive sales insights.

#### Nov 26, 2019
- Continued work and discussion with my team members on how to transform our data for healthcare predictive analytics project.
- Downloaded Kaggle Data Science survey dataset to play around with data visualizations.

#### Nov 27, 2019
- First snowfall in MN means it's now time to switch from outdoor running to snowshoeing, enjoyed some stress free time with a friend going on a quick 1 hr snowshoe hike in reserve near my house.
- Continued reviewing project data, approximate 15 million records and 32 features, trying to decide on best way to deal with missing data and removing features that aren't going to be useful.

#### Nov 28, 2019
- Happy Turkey Day!  Very thankful for all my family and friends!

#### Some metrics to show my progress/improvement during this 30-day challenge:
- Commits made in previous 30 day period (Oct 5, 2019 - Nov 3, 2019): 3/30 = 10%
- Commits made in current 30 day period (Nov 4, 2019 - Dec 3, 2019): 19/30 = 63% (so far...still several days left)
