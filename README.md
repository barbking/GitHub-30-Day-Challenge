## GitHub 30-Day Challenge and Personal Changelog
30 day challenge focused not just on coding but also personal growth.  Goal is to make a habit of committing time each day for learning and personal growth.

### Goals
My goal for the next 30 days is to spend time becoming familiar with Kaggle and their machine learning competitions. Ultimately, I'd like to enter a competition to get more practice in machine learning and increase my data science skillset. However, I have to juggle full-time grad school, being a single parent of two kids in activities, and starting a new job. I'd also like to start reading [Deep Medicine](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Medicine-Artificial-Intelligence-Healthcare/dp/1541644638/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1573235314&sr=8-3), which I bought a couple of months ago and haven't had time to start.

#### Nov 6, 2019
- Reading: The Fourth Industrial Revolution
- Logged 29000 steps on my Garmin watch running around Universal Studios with the kids and spent many hours waiting in line, but 90 minute wait for Hagrid's Magical Creature Motorbike Adventure was worth it.

- Reading: Finished The Fourth Industrial Revolution
- Registered for my last semester of grad school!  Big Data Management and Artificial Intelligence will complete my requirements for a Master of Science degree in Data Science at the University of St. Thomas.  As much as I have loved my classes, it will be nice to have my evenings and weekends back after nearly three years of juggling school, work and kids.

#### Nov 8, 2019
- Catch up time after being in Orlando for short "vacation", if you call running around for five days through multiple parks in Disney and Universal a vacation. :)  Watched both three hour lectures for my Big Data Architecture and Healthcare Analytics classes.  Content this week was stream processing with Spark and predictive analytics in healthcare.
